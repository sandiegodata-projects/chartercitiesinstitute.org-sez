Setting Up Environments
-----------------------


Conda
=====

After you setup and install anaconda, you can create the environment. This installs a lot of packages, 
so it will take a while, but it prevents version conflicts later. 

    $ conda env create -f conda-env.yaml
    $ conda activate sez
